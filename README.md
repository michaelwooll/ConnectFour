# ConnectFour
Connect Four game developed in C++
This is a project for a C++ object orientated course.

In this project I developed and implemented:
- A working game of Connect Four
- A object oriented structure using classes
- Polymorphism using abstract classes
- A basic, working AI that plays a move intelligently
- Binary file input and output to save player games and player data
