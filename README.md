# ConnectFour
Connect Four game developed in C++
This is a project for a C++ object orientated course.


*NOTE: This project is an overcomplicated version. The exaggeration of certain topics like polymorphism and abstract classes was used as a learning experience. The code may show some redundancy. I reccomend looking at board.cpp and board.h for the bulk of my code. As well as player.cpp and player.h for code using I/O files*

In this project I developed and implemented:
- A working game of Connect Four
- An object oriented structure using classes
- Polymorphism using abstract classes
- A basic, working AI that plays a move intelligently
- Binary file input and output to save player games and player data 
- Operator overloading
